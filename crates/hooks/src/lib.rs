/// Trait for implementing lifecycle hooks on job execution.

/// This trait allows you to observe job execution lifecycle events for
/// observability, metrics collection, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns.
///
/// Implement the single method, match on event, and handle the variants you are
/// interested in. For example, you might emit metrics on each event.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use graphile_worker_hooks::{JobLifecycleHooks, LifeCycleEvent};
/// use async_trait::async_trait;
///
/// struct MetricsHooks;
///
/// #[async_trait]
/// impl JobLifecycleHooks for MetricsHooks {
///     async fn on_event(&self, event: LifeCycleEvent) {
///         match event {
///             /// This hook is called immediately before the task handler runs.
///             LifeCycleEvent::Started(started) => todo!(),
///             /// Called when a job completes successfully, after the task handler
///             /// returns Ok and before the job is marked completed in the database.
///             LifeCycleEvent::Completed(completed) => todo!(),
///             /// Called when a job fails, after the task handler returns an error
///             /// and before the job is marked as failed or scheduled for retry.
///             LifeCycleEvent::Failed(failed) => todo!(),
///         }
///     }
